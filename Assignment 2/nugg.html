    <h2>Chicken Nuggets</h2>
    <p>&emsp; Chicken nuggets are bite-sized pieces of chicken that have been breaded and fried until crispy and golden
        brown. They are a popular fast food or convenience food item enjoyed by people of all ages.<br>

        &emsp; Typically, chicken nuggets are made from small chunks of chicken breast or a mixture of chicken meat,
        along with various seasonings and binders. The chicken is usually cut into small, uniform pieces before being
        coated in a seasoned batter or breading mixture. This coating helps to create a crispy exterior when the nuggets
        are cooked.<br>

        &emsp; The exact composition and flavors of chicken nuggets can vary depending on the brand or recipe used. Some
        nuggets have a more uniform texture throughout, while others may have visible chunks of chicken meat. The
        breading can range from a simple seasoned flour coating to a more complex mixture that includes breadcrumbs,
        herbs, and spices.<br>

        &emsp; Chicken nuggets are typically cooked by deep-frying, although they can also be oven-baked or air-fried
        for a healthier alternative. The frying process gives them a crunchy texture on the outside while keeping the
        chicken inside moist and tender. They are often served with various dipping sauces like ketchup, barbecue sauce,
        honey mustard, or sweet and sour sauce.<br>

        &emsp; Chicken nuggets are a popular menu item at fast food restaurants, but they can also be purchased frozen
        from grocery stores and prepared at home. They are commonly enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, or part of a meal,
        and they have become a staple in many households due to their convenience and versatility.</p>
