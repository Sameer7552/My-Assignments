    <h2>French Fries</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;French fries, also known as fries or chips, are a popular side dish made from potatoes. They are typically
        deep-fried until they become crispy on the outside while remaining soft and tender on the inside. French fries
        are enjoyed around the world and are commonly served alongside burgers, sandwiches, or as a standalone
        snack.<br>

        &emsp;To make French fries, potatoes are first peeled and cut into long, slender pieces. The potatoes are then
        rinsed in water to remove excess starch, and they are dried thoroughly to ensure crispiness during frying. The
        frying process involves submerging the potato strips in hot oil until they turn golden brown and develop a
        crispy texture.<br>

        &emsp;French fries can come in various shapes and sizes. They are often cut into long, thin strips, but they can
        also be thicker or even crinkle-cut, depending on personal preference. The outer layer of the fries becomes
        crispy due to the Maillard reaction, which is a chemical reaction that occurs when heat is applied to food,
        resulting in the browning and development of flavors.<br>

        &emsp;Traditionally, French fries are salted immediately after frying to enhance their taste. They are typically
        served hot and can be enjoyed on their own or with a variety of condiments and dips such as ketchup, mayonnaise,
        mustard, barbecue sauce, or aioli. Some variations include loaded fries, which are topped with cheese, bacon,
        and other toppings, or seasoned fries that have additional flavors like garlic, chili powder, or herbs.<br>

        &emsp;While deep-frying is the most common method of cooking French fries, they can also be prepared using
        alternative cooking techniques such as oven-baking or air-frying, which can result in a healthier version of
        this classic side dish.<br>

        &emsp;French fries have become a staple in many fast food chains, restaurants, and households around the world.
        They are loved for their satisfying texture, versatility, and ability to complement a wide range of dishes.<br>
