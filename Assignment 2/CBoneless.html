    <h1>Karhai</h1>
    <h2>Chicken Boneless Karhai</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;Chicken Karhai is a beloved dish in Pakistani and North Indian cuisine that showcases tender pieces of chicken
        cooked in a flavorful and tangy gravy. Prepared in a karhai, a traditional shallow, thick-bottomed cooking pot,
        this dish is a delightful combination of aromatic spices, onions, tomatoes, and ginger-garlic paste.<br>

        &emsp;To begin making Chicken Karhai, start by heating oil in a karhai or a deep cooking pan. Add cumin seeds and
        coriander seeds, allowing them to sizzle and release their fragrant aroma. Then, add finely chopped onions and
        sauté them until they turn golden brown, adding a sweet and savory base to the dish.<br>

        &emsp;Next, incorporate ginger-garlic paste and sauté it for a minute until its rawness dissipates, infusing the dish
        with a depth of flavor. Now, add the chicken pieces to the pot and cook them on medium-high heat until they are
        lightly browned on all sides. This step helps seal in the juices and adds a delicious caramelization to the
        chicken.<br>

        &emsp;Lower the heat and sprinkle in red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt, ensuring that the chicken is evenly
        coated with these aromatic spices. Cover the pot and allow the chicken to cook on low heat until it is tender
        and succulent, usually for about 25-30 minutes. Remember to stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

        &emsp;Once the chicken is cooked, add the chopped tomatoes and sliced green chilies. The tomatoes will release their
        juices and blend with the spices, creating a tangy and flavorful gravy. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the
        flavors meld together, enhancing the taste of the dish.<br>

        &emsp;Finally, sprinkle garam masala powder over the chicken karhai and give it a gentle stir to incorporate all the
        flavors. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves, which add a pop of freshness and color to the dish. Serve hot with
        naan bread, roti, or steamed rice to enjoy the deliciousness of Chicken Karhai.<br>

        &emsp;This dish is perfect for gatherings and special occasions, as it offers a burst of flavors that will leave
        everyone craving for more. The combination of tender chicken, aromatic spices, and tangy gravy makes Chicken
        Karhai a true delight for enthusiasts of Pakistani and North Indian cuisine.<br>
