    <h2>Chicken Paneer Reshmi Handi</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;Chicken Paneer Reshmi Handi is a delightful and flavorful dish that combines tender pieces of chicken and paneer
        (Indian cottage cheese) in a creamy and aromatic gravy. It is a popular dish in Pakistani and North Indian
        cuisine, known for its rich texture and mouthwatering flavors.<br>

        &emsp;To prepare Chicken Paneer Reshmi Handi, boneless chicken and paneer cubes are marinated in a mixture of yogurt,
        ginger, garlic, and a blend of spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The marinade helps
        infuse the chicken and paneer with flavors and tenderizes the meat.<br>

        &emsp;The marinated chicken and paneer are then cooked together in a handi (a traditional clay pot) or a regular
        cooking pot. They are first saut√©ed in oil or ghee until they turn golden brown, which adds depth and richness
        to the dish.<br>

        &emsp;Next, a creamy and flavorful gravy is prepared by combining onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and various
        spices. This mixture is cooked until the ingredients soften and the flavors meld together. To create the creamy
        texture, cashew paste, cream, or a combination of both is added to the gravy, giving it a velvety consistency.<br>

        &emsp;Once the gravy is ready, the seared chicken and paneer are added back to the pot and simmered in the creamy
        sauce until they are fully cooked and infused with the flavors. The result is a delectable dish with succulent
        chicken, paneer that melts in your mouth, and a rich and aromatic gravy.<br>

        &emsp;Chicken Paneer Reshmi Handi is often garnished with fresh coriander leaves and a sprinkle of roasted cumin seeds
        for added aroma and flavor. It pairs well with naan bread, roti, or rice, allowing you to enjoy the creamy and
        savory flavors of this delightful dish. Chicken Paneer Reshmi Handi is a popular choice for special occasions or
        when you want to treat yourself to a decadent and satisfying meal that showcases the fusion of chicken, paneer,
        and spices.<br>
