    <h1>Katakat</h1>
    <h2>Mughaz Plate</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;Mughaz Plate, also known as Katakut, is a popular street food dish in South Asian cuisine, particularly in
        Pakistan. It features a flavorful combination of grilled or stir-fried goat or lamb brain (mughaz) mixed with
        spices, herbs, and served with a side of naan bread or paratha. This unique and indulgent dish is a favorite
        among adventurous food enthusiasts.<br>

        &emsp;To prepare Mughaz Plate or Katakut, follow this simple recipe:<br>

        &emsp;Start by cleaning the goat or lamb brain thoroughly and removing any excess membranes. Then, chop the brain into
        small, bite-sized pieces.<br>

        &emsp;Next, in a pan or skillet, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and saut√© them until
        they turn golden brown, giving the dish a caramelized flavor.<br>

        &emsp;Once the onions are browned, add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute until the raw aroma fades away.<br>

        &emsp;Now, it's time to add the chopped brain pieces to the pan. Stir-fry them for a few minutes until they are cooked
        through and turn slightly golden.<br>

        &emsp;To enhance the flavor, add a blend of aromatic spices such as turmeric, red chili powder, cumin, coriander, and
        salt according to your taste preferences. Mix well to coat the brain pieces evenly with the spices.<br>

        &emsp;Continue cooking for a few more minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Add a splash of water if needed
        to maintain a moist consistency.<br>

        &emsp;Finally, garnish the Mughaz Plate or Katakut with fresh coriander leaves and squeeze some lemon juice over the
        dish to add a tangy twist.<br>

        &emsp;Serve the Mughaz Plate or Katakut hot, alongside naan bread or paratha. It is often enjoyed as a street food
        snack or as a unique addition to a special meal.<br>

        &emsp;Mughaz Plate or Katakut offers a unique culinary experience, showcasing the tender and delicate flavor of goat
        or lamb brain combined with aromatic spices. It is a dish that brings together savory and tangy flavors, perfect
        for those seeking a distinctive taste adventure.<br>
