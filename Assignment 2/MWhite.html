    <h1>Karhai</h1>
    <h2>Mutton White Karhai</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;Mutton Karhai is a beloved dish in Pakistani and North Indian cuisine that showcases the rich and robust flavors
        of mutton (goat meat) cooked in a karhai, a traditional shallow, thick-bottomed cooking pot. This dish is a true
        indulgence for meat lovers, offering tender mutton pieces steeped in a blend of aromatic spices, onions,
        tomatoes, and ginger-garlic paste.<br>

        &emsp;To prepare Mutton Karhai, begin by heating oil in a karhai or a deep cooking pot. Add cumin seeds and coriander
        seeds, allowing them to splutter and release their aroma. Next, add finely chopped onions and sauté them until
        they turn golden brown, infusing the dish with a delightful sweetness.<br>

        &emsp;The next step is to add ginger-garlic paste and sauté it for a minute until the raw flavors dissipate, adding
        depth to the dish. Then, introduce the mutton pieces into the pot and cook them on medium-high heat until they
        attain a slight browning on all sides. This step helps seal in the juices and enhances the flavor of the meat.<br>

        &emsp;Lower the heat and incorporate red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt, ensuring that the mutton pieces are
        evenly coated with these aromatic spices. Cover the pot and allow the mutton to cook on low heat for
        approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it becomes tender and succulent. Remember to stir occasionally to
        prevent sticking.<br>

        &emsp;Once the mutton is cooked to perfection, increase the heat to medium and introduce the chopped tomatoes. The
        tomatoes will add a tangy and juicy element to the dish. Cook until the tomatoes soften and release their
        flavors, creating a delightful sauce that envelops the mutton.<br>

        &emsp;To further enhance the taste, add sliced green chilies and a sprinkle of garam masala powder. These additions
        will contribute a hint of spiciness and a burst of aromatic notes. Let the flavors meld together for another 5-7
        minutes, allowing the dish to reach its full potential.<br>

        &emsp;Finally, garnish the Mutton Karhai with fresh coriander leaves, which add a vibrant touch and a hint of
        freshness. The dish is traditionally served hot with naan bread, roti, or steamed rice, providing the perfect
        accompaniment to savor the rich and flavorful mutton.<br>

        &emsp;Mutton Karhai is a dish that brings people together, often enjoyed as a centerpiece during festive occasions or
        as a comforting and satisfying meal with family and friends. The combination of tender mutton, aromatic spices,
        and tangy tomatoes makes this dish a true delight for those who appreciate the bold flavors of Pakistani and
        North Indian cuisine.<br>
